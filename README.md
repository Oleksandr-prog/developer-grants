# Flow Developer Grants

The Developer Experience team at Flow oversees the grants program for developers. Grant projects should help accelerate and enhance the process of building and consuming apps on Flow.

## How we support you

We price and issue grants in FLOW tokens and provide feedback on milestones. The specific amount and terms are dependent on the project type, scope, and milestones.

> Note: We do not provide hands-on support as part of a grant, but if you face specific issues during development, we will do our best and try to direct you to the correct resources.

## What projects are supported?

We actively look for individuals and teams that build and maintain tools/services and produce technical content primarily targeting other builders in the ecosystem. We expect grants to result in open source contributions to existing or new repositories in the Flow ecosystem.

### Open source maintenance

We want to ensure that contributors can sustain their passion and commitment. Our goal is to increase recurring contributors to Flow-related repositories. For example, discussing implementation details and sending PRs to the [FCL repository](https://github.com/onflow/fcl-js).

### Developer tools and services

We want to support projects that fill ecosystem gaps by building tools and/or services. These are usually not easily monetizable, require significant resourcing, and have an outsized impact on other builders. These projects can include implementation of new and existing features, or tasks to support growth and adoption of Flow tools.

### Technical education

We want to accelerate creation of technical education material to support Flows developers. Some of these projects might require research (e.g. surveying), collaboration with builders and more.

## How to apply?

Create a new issue using the ["Grant Application"](https://github.com/onflow/developer-grants/issues/new?assignees=alxflw&labels=in+review&template=grant-application.md&title=) issue template. Make sure to fill out all the details!

### How are applications evaluated?

We are using the [DVF framework](https://tryble.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/prioritizr/pages/254738466/Design+Thinking+Desirability+Viability+and+Feasibility+DVF) to determine how relevant a project is. Specifically, we are looking for:

- A clear problem statement: What is the evidence showing that it is worth tackling?
- Technical feasibility and track records of contributors: How likely would this be completed as planned?
- Impact to the ecosystem: In what ways does this enrich or accelerate other projects?

### Who is evaluating them?

Grant proposals are reviewed and approved by the Developer Grant Committee (DGC). The committee consists of individuals who know the funding priorities of the Flow ecosystem.

### What happens after the application submission?

The DGC reviews all applications on an ongoing basis. Upon review, we will contact you directly with more questions or next steps.

### What are some of the key ongoing Flow grants?

| Grant | Goal/ Impact | Grantee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Band Protocol Oracle Network integration with Flow | Band Protocol's oracle services would enhance the functionality and reliability of Flow applications by incorporating real-world data. This expands possibilities for use-cases in DeFi, GameFi, prediction markets and more within the ecosystem. | World Data Corporation (“Band Protocol”) |
| Bringing http://untold.io/ platform onto Flow Wallet | By enhancing the diversity of applications on Flow wallet, the range of services and functionalities available to users would be expanded. This increased diversity can attract a broader user base and drive growth in economic activity (GMV) within the ecosystem. | Untold.io |
| A Unity Blockchain Game Course using Flow | First, this will benefit the Flow ecosystem by fostering the creation of innovative blockchain-based games. Second, this initiative will not only attract game developers to Flow but also promote the adoption of Flow in the broader gaming industry, thus expanding the ecosystem's reach and potential. | Rogue Games Limited |
| Develop educational content and guides for Flow Developer | This would help bring more developers to Flow by creating technical content that helps developers understand why they should use Flow/Cadence, and then leads developers through the shift from their current stack to Flow. | Dev Spotlight, LLC |
| Development of tools to build DAO on Flow | This project will help provide an open-source set of tools, documents and code samples for developers to build DAOs on Flow. This would position Flow as a complete ecosystem, where one can not only develop tokens and smart contracts, but also DAOs. | KeyzToTop LLC |
| Fiat-NFT payment plugin for wallets | Fiat-NFT payment solution that plugs into wallets on FLOW would make it faster and cheaper for users to purchase NFTs; additionally, direct card-to-NFT would boost sales for creators by 300% for (Moonpay survey). | Qutrics Carbon Inc. |
| Cadence Testing Framework - issues cleanup and improvements | This enhancement ensures that developers can work with the Cadence Testing Framework more efficiently and with greater confidence, ultimately accelerating the development process and improving the overall experience for Flow ecosystem developers. | Ardit Marku |
| Flowser Interact Screen and UI updates to drive developer productivity | Developers on Flow often need to switch between multiple programs (IDE, Flow CLI, Flowser), which can impact productivity. A brand-new screen for performing blockchain interactions - like executing transactions or scripts - would replace some Flow CLI commands with an easier-to-use and more powerful GUI, improving developer productivity. | Monika Hriberšek |
