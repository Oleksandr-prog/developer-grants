# Flow Developer Grants
The Developer Experience team at Flow offers grants for developers that contribute to the broader developer ecosystem. Grant projects should help accelerate and enhance the process of building and consuming apps on Flow.

## What projects are supported?
We aim to support individuals and teams that build tools, services, and content targeting other builders in the ecosystem.

Generally speaking, grants support work completed, work to be done, and work to facilitate growth. Specifically, that means we focus on the following categories.

### OpenSource maintenance

We want to ensure that contributors can sustain their passion. Our goal is to increase recurring contributors to Flow-related repositories. For example, discussing implementation details and sending PRs to the [FCL repository](https://github.com/onflow/fcl-js).

### Developer Services

We want to support projects that fill ecosystem gaps by building services. These are usually not easily monetizable, require significant resourcing, and have an outsized impact on other builders.

### Product bounties

We want to get more contributors to extend, improve, and grow usage of existing Flow tools. These projects can include implementation of defined features, bug hunting, or other tasks to support growth and adoption of Flow tools.

### Educational material

We want to accelerate creation of educational material produced in the Flow ecosystem. Some of these projects might require research (e.g. surveying), collaboration with builders and more.

## How do we support you?

We distribute FLOW tokens to help development on grant projects in a sustainable way. The amount and distribution timeline is determined on a project basis, by consideration of the project milestones.

## How to apply?
Create a new issue using the ["Grant Application"](https://github.com/onflow/developer-grants/issues/new?assignees=alxflw&labels=in+review&template=grant-application.md&title=) issue template. Make sure to fill out all the details!

### How are applications evaluated?

We are using the [DVF framework](https://tryble.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/prioritizr/pages/254738466/Design+Thinking+Desirability+Viability+and+Feasibility+DVF) to determine how relevant a project is. Specifically, we are looking for:

- A clear problem statement: What is the evidence showing that it is worth tackling?
- Technical feasibility and track records of contributors: How likely would this be completed as planned?
- Impact to the ecosystem: In what ways does this enrich or accelerate other projects?

### Who is evaluating them?

Ultimately, we will establish a grants committee that represents DapperLabs employees, Flow Foundation employees, and key community contributors. In the early phase of the grants program, three DapperLabs employees from the Developer Experience team are evaluating all submissions.

### What happens after the application submission?

Our grant committee reviews all applications on a weekly basis. We will contact you directly with more questions or next steps.
